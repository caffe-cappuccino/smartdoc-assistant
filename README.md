## ☕ About the Project  
**smartdoc-assistant** is your ✨AI-infused documentation bestie✨ — it helps you create, manage, and prettify project docs without losing your sanity (or spilling your latte).  

It’s got both the **brains** (Python backend 🧠) and the **looks** (frontend UI 💅).  
Think of it as Notion meets GitHub meets a girl with too many tabs open 😌  

---

## 💫 Features  
- 🧠 Smart backend for processing and logic  
- 💻 Frontend that’s cute *and* functional  
- 📦 Modular architecture for easy dev flow  
- 🪄 Extensible — add AI doc gen, summaries, or chatbots  
- 🐍 Built mainly with Python, with some spicy C/C++ bits
